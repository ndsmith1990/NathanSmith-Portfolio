      <p class="bg-white outline paragraph">
          Finally, the <i>World of Health</i> has been deployed! I will definitely say that it is not perfect
          (or even mostly running for that matter), but all the initial set up is done. The screens are set up the
          way that I want them for the most part, the database is completely set up, and the server is....not working
          correctly yet. There is still so much work to be done on this project, but I promise that one day it will be
          done. And of course, I will keep you updated on how it is going. But, without further ado, a brief summary of
          the current functionality and the known bugs.

          Ok, so, the bad news is that, due to time constraints, I had to cut out a feature. I had to cut out the run tracker.
          I know that it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I said that it would be part of the <i>World of Health</i> and I
          plan on keeping that promise...eventually.

      <h3 class="small-title">Known Bugs</h3>
      <p class="bg-white outline paragraph">
          Alright, down to the nitty-gritty details; the stuff that no programmer wants to talk about. There are a lot of
          known bugs currently in the <i>World of Health</i>. The biggest problem currently, is that only one tracker currently
          saves information to the database, as far as I know (I haven't tested all of them yet). Secondly, the graph that
          I promised would be on each tracker is currently broken. Thanks to Ted Holmberg (who showed me <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">plotly</a>),
          that should be fixed as soon as I can devote more time to working on this app (currently have to focus on work
          and finals; gotta make that money and graduate). Similarly, the table on each tracker is not fully fleshed out.
          Admittedly, these bugs make the app completely unusable (I know, I know, it makes me mad too). I promise you,
          these bugs will be fixed (hopefully by the end of summer) and the <i>World of Health</i> will be a fully functional application!
