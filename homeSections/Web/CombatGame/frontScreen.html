      <h1>Welcome to Fantasy Battle!</h1>
      <p>This game is going to be a little bit different. Instead of the player being the "good guy", you play as
        an Orc that has just lost the rest of his scouting party and has stumbled on an opponent.</p>
      <h4>Rules</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You have 200 health points, you lose all, you lose the game.</li>
        <li>You have 20 points that you can put into either strength or magic.</li>
        <li>Your opponent will be picked randomly and will either be an Elf, a Knight, or a Gnome.</li>
        <li>To use your magic, you must have 5 magic points. These points do regenerate over time (1 point per turn).</li>
        <li>When the enemy uses magic, there is the possibility of your character getting stunned. While stunned you cannot attack.
          This is also true for your magic attacks.</li>
        <li>While selecting your strength, remember that a random number between 0 and your strength will be picked for your damage.</li>
        <li>There is a possibility of either side doing a critical strike. This will add 5 damage points to the hit and the possibility of being stunned.</li>
        <li>Both you and your opponent have 3 potions to heal the user by 50 points. Use them wisely.</li>
      </ul>
