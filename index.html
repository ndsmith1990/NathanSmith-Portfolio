        <h4> Nathaniel (Nathan) Smith </h4>
        <p> I was born in 1990 and grew up as an only child in a military family. Instead of sticking to my original plan of college after I graduated high
          school, I joined the Air Force because I had a young family to care for. During my time in the military, I worked as an aircraft maintenance crew
          chief and a specialist in the tool storage facility. In my civilian life after the military, I worked my way up in a telecommunications company
          to a workforce management postion, which I held for a little over a year. It was at this point that I decided that I was going to finally fulfill
          my dream of going to college. I was able to get an internship as an Integration Specialist at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana while in my junior year.
          I am currently a senior at the University of New Orleans graduating in May of 2020.
